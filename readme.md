# Mass Random Rename

This `bash` script lets you rename all the files in a directory to  random alphanumeric strings, while keeping their extensions.
For when "Leaning Tower of Pisa.jpg" is too much for your space-phobic file processor.

## "Install" (I think you can paste this directly)
```bash
cd ~/Documents # or wherever you want to download
git clone https://github.com/robotitect/mass_random_rename.git
alias mass_random_rename="bash ~/Documents/mass_random_rename/script.sh" # or wherever you downloaded/script.sh
```

## Usage
```bash
cd directory_with_files_i_want_renamed
mass_random_rename
```
